## Prerequisites

• Node.js (v14 or higher): [Download here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer)\
• MySQL (v8 or higher): [Download here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)\
• NPM (comes with Node.js)\
• Any Code Editor (e.g., VS Code): [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)\
• MySQL workbench: [Download here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)

## Important: Database and Backend Setup

Before setting up the frontend, ensure that you have followed the backend setup instructions. The frontend interacts with the backend API, so it’s essential to have the backend server running for full functionality. Please refer to the backend README [here](https://github.bath.ac.uk/msk98/fundraising_website_be) for setup instructions and make sure the backend server is running on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

## Frontend Setup

Open the Frontend Project: Navigate to the fundraising_website_fe folder in VS Code.

### `npm install`

Open the terminal in VS Code, navigate to the fundraising_website_fe folder, and run the following command to install all the backend dependencies.

### `npm start`

Starts the frontend.\
The frontend should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Running the Application

Once the frontend server is running, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view and interact with the application. Ensure that the backend server is running simultaneously for the application to work properly.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
